# FaceDetection
Nota bene: This was work done in my machine learning course during my Master's program at Berkeley. Please note that the file lists the author as Chris Miller, though you probably now know me as Cassandra Miller or Cassie Miller.  Suffice to say I've had some big life changes.

This notebook demonstrates how a convolutional neural network can be trained to recognize the presence of faces in an image. It's been about 7 years since I did this work, and I'm fully aware that machine learning and AI have come a long way since this notebook was created. Also, I wouldn't attempt to run this on your local machine as this was originally run in an AWS GPU cluster and it still took more than 48 hours to train the network.
